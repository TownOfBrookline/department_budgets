# Information Technology FY2015 Program Budget

## PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Information Technology (IT) plays a key role in Brookline's ability to educate its children, respond
to emergencies, and efficiently provide services to its citizens. Investments in IT
applications and infrastructure provide managers with tools to operate more
efficiently, increase productivity, and manage the financial, physical, and human
resources of the Town. The Department is led by the Chief Information Officer
(CIO), who serves in this capacity for both the Town and the Schools. (This budget
reflects only the Town resources available to the Department; there are also IT funds
included in the School Department budget.)

The Department's mission is to use technology so as to enhance the delivery of Town
and School services to the community. It is responsible for the integration of all
activities and resources designated as:

1. Systems and data processing, comprised of computer-based systems design and
implementation, applications, and operating software;
1. Telecommunications systems and networks, comprised of the integration of
planning, development, and implementation of all systems and network services;
1. Delivery of applications and other information services products that meet the
users' specifications in terms of quality and cost;

1. Identification of opportunities in the development and support of new and existing
technologies; and
1. Training of employees in the use of various aspects of information technology.

The ITD has four divisions: Administration, Application Management, Network
Support, and the Help Desk. A brief description of each is listed below:
