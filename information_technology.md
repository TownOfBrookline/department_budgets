# Information Technology FY2010 Program Budget

## PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
Information Technology is key to Brookline's ability to grow, educate its children,
respond to emergencies, and efficiently provide services to its citizens. Investments
in IT applications and infrastructure provide managers with tools to more effectively
observe and manage the financial, physical, and human resources of the Town, as
well as increase productivity. The Department is lead by the Chief Information
Officer (CIO) who serves in this capacity for both the Town and the Schools. This
budget reflects only the Town resources available to the Department. There are also
IT funds included in the School Department budget.

The Department's mission is to use technology so as to enhance the delivery of Town
and School services to the community. It is responsible for the integration of all
activities and resources designated as:

1. Systems and data processing, comprised of computer-based systems design and
implementation, applications, and operating software;
1. Telecommunications systems and networks, comprised of the integration of
planning, development, and implementation of all systems and network services;
1. Delivery of applications and other information services products that meet the
users' specifications in terms of quality and cost;
1. Protection of the Town's computer data and information assets and resources;
1. Identification of opportunities in the development and support of new and existing
technologies; and
1. Training of employees in the use of various aspects of information technology.

The ITD has four divisions: Administration, Application Management, Network
Support, and the Help Desk. A brief description of each is listed below:

**Administration** - provides continuous coordination of the divisions through effective
leadership so that all technology-related aspects of Brookline's government are
functioning effectively and efficiently. These responsibilities are accomplished under
the direction of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) with the assistance of the
Director of IT Applications.

**Application Management** - is responsible for those functions related to providing,
maintaining, and supporting the use of software needed to meet the operational,
management, and reporting requirements of the Brookline organization.

maintaining, and supporting the connectivity between the organization's computers
and systems software.
